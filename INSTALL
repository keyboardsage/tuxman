This program can be built and installed in multiple ways.
Choose the build option below that you are most comfortable with.

Scons:
If you have the scons build system installed simply navigate to this
directory and type "scons" in the commandline. Type "scons -c" to
clean up.

AutoMake:
If you don't have scons installed but you have make installed, then
navigate to this directory and type "make". Type "make install" to
install the program on your system. Type "make clean" to clean up.

Codeblocks:
If you don't have either of these two programs then open up .cbp
file in the Codeblocks IDE and compile the program that way.
You may have to resolve issues by changing the paths to reflect
where includes and libraries are on your system.
