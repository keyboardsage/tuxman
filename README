======General Information======
Tuxman is an open source game similar to pacman for Atari but not
designed to be a clone of it. I consider it to be in the Pre-Alpha
phase. Please report any bugs you find! :-)

======License======
This program is under the GPL license. For the details of the license
read the file called "LICENSE" in this same directory. Changes should
be sent to malachix@users.sourceforge.net.

======Installation======
For installation instructions read the INSTALL file.  Ensure
that you have the below libraries on your system before
attempting to build or install the application:

* SDL		<http://www.libsdl.org/>
* SDL_Mixer	<http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/>
* libSpiff	<http://libspiff.sourceforge.net/>
* OpenGL	<http://www.opengl.org/>
* libjsw	<http://wolfpack.twu.net/libjsw/>

======Expanding======
For creating levels visit the LEVELS file.

======Layout======
src - C++ source code for the application
resources - Holds all files used by the game
build - Holds build systems/project files
tools - For the developers
attic - Deprecated code things that are long forgotten

======Known Issues======
- FPS is slightly higher than target FPS
- FPS not accurately reporting when target FPS is to high
