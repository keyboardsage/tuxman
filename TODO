Rough Draft (Pre-alpha):
Render score, lives, and bonus type on screen
Implement enemy movement
Implement Tuxman/Enemy collision (Tuxman dies if touched)
Make big food blink
Make big food disappear (accumulate score)
Make big food cause enemies to temporary stun if eaten
Spawn Bonus types
Add sound effects
Add images
Implement highscore (goes to this instead of transition at level end)
Create main GUI (Play, Options(undone), Highscore, Help, Quit)
Package main.cpp functionality into namespace or class
Config(stores user/level config) object has default config & loads diffs
Buildable & Installable with Automake

Rough Draft 2 (Pre-alpha):
2nd level
Transitions between levels
Use astyler/cpp beautifier
Buildable & Installable with Scons
Put documentation into repo (use cases etc.)

Refinement (Alpha):
Make configuration files use Boost Serialization and save in xml
Boost Program Options for commandline options
Man page (ensure option for debug mode in colors, comes in useful)
More levels/art

Refinement 2 (Alpha):
Unit testing
Check for memory leaks w/ valgrind & new/delete keyword overloading

More Refinement (Beta):
Joystick support with SDL

Possible Improvement:
Boost Python for embeddable python algorithms for enemies
Random level generation play option
Boost ASIO or SDL_Net for networking
Able to record games
