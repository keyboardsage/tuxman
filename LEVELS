Legend:
The meaning of the characters used to generate maps in the
".lvl files" are as follows:

b - Blue Wall
a - Background (if nothing on this tile then dot)
c - Background (if nothing on this tile then big dot)
e - Gate
1 - Blinky
2 - Pinky
3 - Inky
4 - Clyde
5 - Tuxman

Levels:
Levels are easy to create. Simply write 29 characters for
31 lines. The characters must be characters that exist in
the legend above.  Save that file as LevelNameHere.lvl

Then in another file create metadata to describe your
levels other attributes like where tuxman should start
off at. Save this as SameLevelNameHere.meta

Put both of those files into the Resources/level folder.

For ease, you can just use an existing set of level files
as a template.
